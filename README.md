The first sketch is the site for a CAFKA '18 Biennial in KW Canada. The second sketch is of my studio, a storefront in Ridgewood Queens. The third sketch represents a grafitti / mural spot in Bushwick Brooklyn. 

Project 1: There's a square pie chart and many colorful slices. Here are two possible interations: a rollover function changes the colors; a time-based function will change the number of slices as some aspect of a dataset changes. Thalmic, a Canadian 'wearable tech' company sponsors the artwork. The goal of the first project is to animate the project with p5. 

Project 2: There's a storefront. Possible interactions include vector-based graphics on an opaque sign space above the plate glass, and the kinect libraries on the glass.  The goal of the second project is to engage the street - to activate the storefront with interactive graphics. 

Project 3: It's a mural. The dimensions are 90 x 30 x 15 feet. It's going to use spatial geometry around (a.) features of the building and (b.) environmental data. Inspiration for this project comes from http://reinoudvanlaar.nl/project/leavespattern/. The goal of the third project is to use processing as a drawing tool.

In each case I am curious to see how the digital version acts in relation to the physical version.
