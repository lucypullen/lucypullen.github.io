The first sketch represents the site for the project with CAFKA. There's a square pie chart and many colorful slices. Here are two possible interations: a rollover function changes the colors; a time-based function will change the number of slices as some aspect of a dataset changes. Thalmic, a Canadian 'wearable tech' company sponsors the artwork. The goal of the first project is to animate the project with p5. 

The second sketch represents my storefront studio. Possible interactions include vector-based graphics on an opaque sign space above the plate glass, and the kinect libraries on the glass.  The goal of the second project is to engage the street - to activate the storefront with interactive graphics. 

The third sketch represents our grafitti spot. Spatial geometry, like voronoi, will wrap around the corner. Spatial geometry responds to around (a.) features of the building, (b.) environmental data and, (c.) graffitti.  Inspiration for this project comes from http://reinoudvanlaar.nl/project/leavespattern/. The goal of the third project is to use processing as a drawing tool.
