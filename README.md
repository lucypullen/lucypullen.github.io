 Three public projects are on the face of three buildings. The first sketch is the site for a public project in June 2018 for the CAFKA Biennial with Thalmic, a Canadian startup located at 27 Gaukel, in Kitchener Waterloo. The second sketch is of my studio, a storefront in Ridgewood Queens. The third sketch represents a grafitti / mural spot in Bushwick Brooklyn. 

I am learning to use use processing as a drawing tool. The first project uses processing to animate the artwork online, as an interactive object, with p5.js. The second project uses processing to engage with the street. The third project uses processing as an iterative design tool with vector-based graphics, libraries and environmental data.
